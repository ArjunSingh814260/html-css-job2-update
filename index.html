          <h1>EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION COACHING</h1>
            <p>
              Are you in business, politics, or a position of responsibility? Do you
              want to influence those around you in a way that improves your
              reputation?
            </p>
            <p>
            Do you want to be understood and remembered? Would you like to be
            highly respected and for people to act on what you’ve said after
            meeting you in person. Would you like to be able to tell a compelling
            story or give a speech that has your audience hooked? Maybe your needs
            are a little more human and lower key…maybe you’d like more
            confidence, to be more approachable and likeable and to influence
            other people in a way that generates warmth, admiration and
            connection… </p><p>If so, this is your opportunity to be personally coached
            by the Founder & CEO of the foremost professional skills training
            company in the world.</p> <p>For the last 20 years Nick Smallman, has been
            showing people all over the world how to develop their Charisma,
            Gravitas and Presence. These are the essential attributes of all
            highly successful people, and his executive coaching will give you
            these skills. </p><h6>A different coaching method </h6><p>A lot of executive coaching
            fails because the client is told what to do and to replace their
            current methods and technique. Unfortunately, human beings are
            creatures of habit and insecurity. Usually, we all revert to old
            behaviours, so the new way gets lost. </p>
            <h6>Reorganising the mind</h6> <p>Nick will
            show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and communicator by
            using a series of psychological techniques that once employed and
            embedded, strengthen your ability over time. Good coaching is about
            changing your mind on a fundamental level rather than showing you what
            to do. Real growth is psychological. The physical will follow. He will
            teach you techniques not by telling you what to do but instead by
            giving you solutions that embed themselves in your thinking. Over
            time, many of the things you thought were beyond possibility become
            easy and natural.
